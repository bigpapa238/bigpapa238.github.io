        <p>I’m an honest and reliable individual with a deep sense of compassion for people and for the passions that
            fuel me. Whether I’m helping others or diving into my favorite hobbies, I bring sincerity, dedication, and
            heart
            to everything I do. I believe in showing up fully, staying curious, and always striving to grow.
            More than anything, I’m on a journey to discover who I truly am and build a life filled with joy, purpose,
            and authenticity.</p>

        <p> My dream is to
            attend cosmetology school, where I can turn my passion for beauty and self-expression into a career.
            I value the power of transformation, not just in appearance but in
            confidence and spirit. Through cosmetology, I hope to empower people to feel seen, celebrated, and beautiful
            in their own skin. Each step I take brings me closer to a future where I can blend artistry with empathy,
            and make a lasting impact one person at a time.</p>
